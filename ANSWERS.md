1. What is the complexity of your algorithm (in big O notation)?
    The complexity of my algorithm is O(n²). 

2. How would you improve your algorithm?
    By a better use of the OOP. And creating an Object for every vessel types. So it will be easier for me to pared them.

3. How would your adapt your algorithm to three dimensions? How would that affect
the complexity?
    In think that in three demensions the complexity off my Alghorithm will still remain O(n²).
